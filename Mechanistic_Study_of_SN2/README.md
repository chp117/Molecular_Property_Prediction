# Mechanistic Study of SN2 Reaction

This project presents a computational investigation of the SN2 reaction mechanism between methyl chloride (CH‚ÇÉCl) and fluoride anion (F‚Åª), leading to the substitution product methyl fluoride (CH‚ÇÉF). The study includes transition state (TS) search, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations, energy profile generation, and geometry analysis using Psi4 and Python.

## üß™ Reaction Overview

**CH‚ÇÉCl + F‚Åª ‚Üí CH‚ÇÉF + Cl‚Åª**

This is a classic bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The goal of this study is to visualize the potential energy surface (PES) and understand the changes in bonding throughout the reaction path.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Psi4** ‚Äì quantum chemistry package for electronic structure calculations
- **NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib / py3Dmol** ‚Äì for analysis and visualization

## üìä Workflow Summary

1. **Geometry Optimizations** for reactants, products, intermediates, and TS
2. **Frequency Calculations** to confirm TS (one imaginary frequency)
3. **IRC Calculations** (forward and backward) to confirm connection between minima and TS
4. **Single Point Energy Calculations** at MP2/6-31++G(d,p) level
5. **Zero-Point Energy (ZPE) Corrections**
6. **Potential Energy Surface (PES) Plot**
7. **Bond Length and Angle Table** summarizing mechanistic changes

## üìÑ Files Included

- `sn2_study.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis
- `*.dat`: Output files from Psi4 calculations
- `TS_animation.gif`: Vibrational mode of TS
