# Computational Mechanistic Study of S<sub>N</sub>2 Reaction

This project presents a computational investigation of the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction mechanism between methyl chloride (CH‚ÇÉCl) and fluoride anion (F‚Åª), leading to the substitution product methyl fluoride (CH‚ÇÉF). The study includes transition state (TS) search, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations, energy profile generation, and geometry analysis using Psi4 and Python.

## üß™ Reaction Overview

**CH‚ÇÉCl + F‚Åª ‚Üí CH‚ÇÉF + Cl‚Åª**

This is a classic bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S<sub>N</sub>2) reaction. The goal of this study is to calculate the potential energy surface (PES) and understand the changes in molecule geometry throughout the reaction path.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Psi4** ‚Äì quantum chemistry package for electronic structure calculations
- **NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib / py3Dmol** ‚Äì for analysis and visualization

## Visualization Note

**Important:** The interactive 3D molecular visualizations powered by `py3Dmol` **do not render on GitHub** due to JavaScript restrictions.

## üìä Workflow Summary

1. **Geometry Optimizations** for reactants, products, intermediates, and TS
2. **Frequency Calculations** to confirm Minima and TS (imaginary frequency)
3. **IRC Calculations** (forward and backward) to confirm connection between minima and TS
4. **Single Point Energy Calculations** at MP2/6-31++G(d,p) level
5. **Zero-Point Energy (ZPE) Corrections**
6. **Potential Energy Surface (PES) Plot**

## üìÑ Files Included
